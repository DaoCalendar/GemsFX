## DrawerStackPane

A stackpane with an optional node that can be shown inside a drawer. The drawer is animated and can slide in and out. When the drawer is showing a semi-transparent glass pane will cover the background. In addition the last height of the drawer can be persisted via the preferences API so that next time the drawer will show itself like in the last user session.
